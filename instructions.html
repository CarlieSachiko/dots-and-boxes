      <p>Welcome to the game of Dots and Boxes! This is a classic pencil-and-paper game brought to life online by your friendly neighborhood WDI student. <br><br>
      Here is how the game works:<br>
      You begin with an empty grid of dots. The object of the game is to create as many boxes as possible. Each player takes their turn to "draw" their line on the grid. Once that line is placed it cannot be changed or overwritten. If the line you place creates a box, you win that box! If you create a box you get another turn. But be careful not to let your opponent win their own boxes. <br>
      <br>Now that you know how to play, let's have some fun!</p>
