      <p>Welcome to the game of Dots and Boxes! This is a classic two-player, pencil-and-paper game brought to life online by your friendly neighborhood WDI student. <br><br>
      Here is how the game works:<br>
      You begin with an empty grid of dots. The object of the game is to create as many boxes as possible. Each player takes their turn to "draw" their line on the grid. Once that line is placed it cannot be changed or overwritten. If the line you place creates a box, you win that box and you get another turn! But remember to think ahead and prevent your opponent from winning their own boxes!<br><br>
      You ready? <a href='game-page.html'>Let's do this!</a></p>
